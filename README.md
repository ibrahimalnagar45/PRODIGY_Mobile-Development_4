# Tic Tac Toe Game in Flutter

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built using Flutter. This app allows users to play the classic game in different modes, either against a friend or AI with varying difficulty levels. The game includes a grid-based interface, with players alternating between 'X' and 'O'. The app supports both local multiplayer and AI gameplay with two difficulty modes (easy and hard).

## Features

- **Multiple Game Modes:**
  - **Play with Friend**: Two players can play on the same device.
  - **Play with Easy AI**: Play against an AI that makes random moves.
  - **Play with Hard AI**: Play against an AI that uses the Minimax algorithm for optimal moves.

- **Intuitive UI**: The game features a grid where players tap on cells to place their marks ('X' or 'O').

- **Game Flow:**
  - The app automatically detects when a player wins or when the game is a draw.
  - After the game ends, players can restart the game with a button press.

- **AI Logic:**
  - **Easy Mode**: The AI makes random moves.
  - **Hard Mode**: The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal decisions, providing a challenging gameplay experience.
